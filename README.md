## Synopsis
This includes the brief PowerPoint file, code, and data files used during a talk at the Winston-Salem R Users Group MeetUp held on December 11, 2017. The talk demonstrated image processing with the `EBImage` package from the bioconductor. Once the repository is downloaded the two R scripts ('imaging_demo script.R' and 'case studies script.R') can be used to recreate the talk. Note that the scripts are meant to be executed line-by-line and are not meant to be sourced. There are frequent calls to interact with the operator.  

Included here is a folder representing package still under development, `virustiter`. The folder needs to be downloaded and then should be loaded locally with `load_all()` of the `devtools` package. This is necessary only to run the final example in the 'case studies script.R'.

Many thanks are due to the creators and maintainers of EBImage (Gregoire Pau, Florian Fuchs, Oleg Sklyar, Michael Boutros and Wolfgang Huber) as well as Wayne Rasband, creator of ImageJ.
